    <h1>My favourites</h1>

    <h3 id="h31">Soccer</h3>
    <p class="p1">
      My first favourite thing is soccer. Soccer is a sport involving kicking a
      ball into a net to score a point. This game is team based and heavily
      relies on team work and strategies

    <h3 id="h32">Studying</h3>
    <p class="p1">
      My second favourite thing is studying. Studying helps me relax and focus
      in stressfull times. I also like to use
      <strong><em>Quizlet</em></strong> to help me with studying. Things that I
      study for are:

    <h3 id="h33">Gaming</h3>
    <p class="p1">
      My last favourite thing is gaming. Gaming involves using tactical
      strategies to take advantage of the other team and be able to win against
      them. that is one main reason that I like to game as it uses a lot of
      thinking skill and reaction time. It has also been proven to increase
      reaction time in people as it is alright to play about 1 hour per day to
      improve and keep the reaction time of the person the same. I like to play
      a game called <strong><em>rainbow six siege</em></strong> for those
      reasons.

    <h3 id="h34">Talking with people</h3>
    <p class="p1">
      I like to talk with my family members about things. This helps me get
      along with them more and makes me more confident when speaking with
      others. This also makes me more connected with my family members and I
      will be able to understand what they go through from these expieriences.
      This also allows me to help them during times of needs and figure out ways
      to solve issues with them. I also like using
      <strong> <em>youtube</em></strong> to help me find some socializing
      techniques
